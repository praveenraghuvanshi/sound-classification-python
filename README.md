### Tittle: Sound Classification using ML.Net

### Abstract

Every wondered how a Machine Learning algorithm identifies and classifies a sound? In this session, I'll start with basics of sound,  followed by working of it using Machine Learning. We'll explore the sound dataset, perform analysis on it and build a multi class sound classifier using ML.Net framework.
